# AstroViz Project

AstroViz is a Python-based data visualization project that uses data from various sources to create graphs depicting the Moon, asteroids, comets, and solar flares.

## Data

The data used in this project is provided in CSV format and includes information on the following:

- Moon phases and distances
- Asteroid names, sizes, and distances from Earth
- Comet names, orbits, and dates of visibility
- Solar flare intensities and dates

## Libraries Used

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- Pandas: for data manipulation and processing
- Plotly: for creating interactive data visualizations
- Plotly Subplot: for arranging multiple plots in a grid
- Plotly Graph Object: for creating custom visualizations

## Graphs

The following graphs are generated in AstroViz:


### Moon Phases

A line graph depicting the phases of the Moon over time.

### Moon Distance

A scatter plot depicting the distance of the Moon from Earth over time.

### Asteroid Sizes

A bar chart depicting the sizes of various asteroids in kilometers.

### Asteroid Distances

A scatter plot depicting the distances of various asteroids from Earth in millions of kilometers.

### Comet Orbits

A 3D scatter plot depicting the orbits of various comets around the Sun.

### Comet Visibility

A scatter plot depicting the dates of visibility for various comets.

### Solar Flare Intensity

A line graph depicting the intensity of solar flares over time.

## Conclusion

AstroViz provides a comprehensive data visualization of various astronomical phenomena using Python libraries. With the help of Plotly Subplot and Graph Object libraries, it is easy to create interactive and customized visualizations that can aid in astronomical research and understanding.
